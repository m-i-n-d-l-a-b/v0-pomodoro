# Supabase Authentication Integration To-Do List

This checklist outlines the tasks required to add robust, type-safe Supabase Authentication to the application.

## 1. Discovery & Planning
- [ ] Document the current authentication strategy (if any) and identify areas to replace or augment with Supabase.
- [ ] Define target user flows (sign-up, email verification, sign-in, sign-out, password reset, social OAuth, etc.).
- [ ] Confirm compliance, data residency, and security requirements that may impact Supabase configuration.
- [ ] Decide on multi-environment strategy (development, staging, production) and required Supabase projects.

## 2. Supabase Project Setup
- [ ] Create the Supabase project(s) and enable email/password plus any required OAuth providers.
- [ ] Configure authenticated email templates, redirect URLs, and password recovery policies in the Supabase dashboard.
- [ ] Generate service role and anon keys; store them securely in the secrets manager for each environment.
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on relevant tables and draft high-level access control rules.

## 3. Local Environment Configuration
- [ ] Install the required dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`, and supporting type definitions.
- [ ] Add `.env.local` entries for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; mirror the setup for other environments via the deployment platform.
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to ensure secrets are never committed.
- [ ] If using the Supabase CLI locally, configure the CLI project and connect it to the remote Supabase instance.

## 4. Supabase Client & Type Safety
- [ ] Run `supabase gen types typescript --project-id <id>` (or configure the CLI) to produce generated types for the database schema.
- [ ] Store generated types in a dedicated module (e.g., `lib/database.types.ts`) and export them for reuse across the codebase.
- [ ] Implement a singleton Supabase client factory for server and browser contexts that enforces the generated types.
- [ ] Ensure all helper functions accept and return explicitly typed values; avoid `any` and guard against nullable fields.

## 5. Authentication Helpers & Session Management
- [ ] Configure Supabase Auth Helpers middleware for Next.js to read and refresh sessions on server-rendered routes and API handlers.
- [ ] Implement utilities to retrieve the current session/user on the server (e.g., `getServerSession`) and on the client (React hooks).
- [ ] Handle token refresh logic, including graceful fallbacks when refresh fails (redirect to sign-in, clear cookies, surface errors).
- [ ] Decide on storage for persistent auth state (cookies vs. local storage) and ensure HTTP-only cookies for sensitive tokens.

## 6. UI & User Flows
- [ ] Build accessible sign-up and sign-in forms with validation (email format, password strength, provider errors).
- [ ] Add password reset, magic link, and OAuth provider buttons as needed; handle provider-specific errors explicitly.
- [ ] Provide user feedback for pending states, success confirmation, and error conditions.
- [ ] Create a sign-out action that revokes the session on both the client and server.
- [ ] Update navigation/header components to reflect authenticated vs. anonymous states.

## 7. Authorization & Access Control
- [ ] Map application roles/permissions to Supabase policies; write SQL policy definitions and document them.
- [ ] Ensure protected routes and API endpoints verify the Supabase session before returning sensitive data.
- [ ] Add middleware or server components to redirect unauthenticated users away from restricted pages.
- [ ] Audit existing API routes/server actions to enforce authorization based on Supabase session claims.

## 8. Data Modeling & Migration
- [ ] Create or update tables to store profile metadata linked to `auth.users` via foreign keys.
- [ ] Write migration scripts (SQL or Supabase migrations) for any schema changes and test them locally.
- [ ] Populate seed data required for development/testing while respecting security policies.

## 9. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for auth utilities, ensuring they handle null/undefined inputs and Supabase errors.
- [ ] Add integration tests covering core flows (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, password reset, OAuth).
- [ ] Configure end-to-end tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress) to simulate user auth journeys against a test Supabase project.
- [ ] Mock Supabase client responses for deterministic tests where full integration is unnecessary.

## 10. Observability & Error Handling
- [ ] Implement structured logging around authentication events for debugging and monitoring.
- [ ] Capture Supabase errors with the existing error-reporting tool (e.g., Sentry) and include context for troubleshooting.
- [ ] Monitor Supabase status limits (auth rate limits, email quotas) and set up alerts for critical thresholds.

## 11. Deployment & Release Checklist
- [ ] Configure environment variables for each deployment target (preview, staging, production) via the hosting platform.
- [ ] Verify serverless/edge runtime compatibility for Supabase Auth Helpers if using middleware.
- [ ] Run smoke tests post-deploy to validate session handling, protected routes, and provider logins.
- [ ] Document rollback procedures if Supabase auth causes incidents post-release.

## 12. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
- [ ] Update the main README or internal docs with Supabase setup instructions and required environment variables.
- [ ] Document how to run Supabase locally (if applicable) and how to manage database migrations.
- [ ] Create runbooks for support teams covering common auth issues and recovery steps.
- [ ] Schedule a walkthrough/demo for the team once integration is complete.

## 13. Post-Integration Maintenance
- [ ] Plan recurring reviews of Supabase updates, breaking changes, and security advisories.
- [ ] Set calendar reminders to rotate service role keys and audit access policies regularly.
- [ ] Track metrics for sign-up conversion, auth errors, and session duration to inform future improvements.
